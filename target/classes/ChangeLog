Added an application.properties file to connect to my local MySQL server
Moved EbookApplication outside of its own package, the application scans its current package and all sub-packages so it could not find anything


When you use the Repository interface methods FindByID(UUID userID) the Repo will look for a field named Id in user which does not exist
    It must therefore be refactored to FindByUserId instead, I've tried to account for all instances of this problem

    This problem is prevalent throughout all the classes as well such as eBookIds and the like
    Also, there is a case-sensitivity issue, some are EbookId and some are EbookID which are not compatible
    eBook Ebook and EBook are causing similar issue (I am going clinically insane)

There are 2 POST maps in the User controller with no specified URL path so conflicts arise
    I've changed the PostMapping endpoint for loginUser method to /login for now so the code compiles but this may need to be changed

Note: From now on, all eBooks must be referred to as either ebook or Ebook to prevent case sensitivity issues

The ReviewRepository has a method to find a review by user, but no user Field exists in the Review class
    I have added this field and added the parameter to all instantiations of review
    The same problem existed for title which has also been fixed

FindAllLoans() method in LoanRepository is looking for a field name AllLoans which does not exist.
    The JPA repository already provides findAll() as standard so I've removed this method


The final issue was that LoanId does not exist in review, so finding by LoanId will not work
    changing this to findByLoan_LoanId seemed to have fixed it

IT COMPILES NOW HOORAH
